The home screen of my phone is in many ways the easiest way to introduce myself to someone. It tells a lot about me. Obviously the apps I choose to display say something about who I am and what my interests are, but the way I organize also my phone gives a peak inside to how I think. In general phones sit in a unique position in most people lives. They are the ubiquitous piece of technology; more than a laptop or tablet, it's the technology that is always with you.

The home screen of my phone is in very ways an aspirational ideal with how I use it to compliment my life. Not only do I put the apps I use the most on the home screen and within easy reach of my thumb, but I also put the apps I want to use more on the home screen. I am frequently reserving room for apps that I feel should be part of my life. Because of this, I am constantly fiddling with the apps and the order. This post is meant to kick off a series of post detailing how I change my home screen over time to fine tune it around what is important to me.

The wallpaper comes form the great podcast [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/3). Additionally, the idea of putting a top row of folders to pick up all my apps came from [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) as well. This allows me to have one screen to use and really speeds up my interactions with the phone. Apps I want to use are on the home screen, so I can quickly access them. Everything else I just search for. There are no badges currently up on my screen and that is not but accident. I reserve badges for interrupt driven activities. I only want a badge to appear if I should stop what I'm doing and deal with it. Very few apps meet that threshold. I also like to keep an empty row to make the screen feel a clean. I don't know why, but when I have apps on the bottom row, I start to feel cluttered when using the phone and I don't like it. I will occasionally use the bottom row when I travel, to move out momentarily important apps, but as soon as I'm settled in, they go back to their folders

## The Dock
The dock serves as the most critical apps that I need access to at all times. **[Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)** and **[OmniFocus](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)** are probably the first two apps I would install if I have to start over with a phone. Drafts is launched whenever I need to type and OmniFocus manages almost everything I need to do.

## Words
You might notice that I have two email apps. This isn't some sort of mistake. I prefer to keep my work and personal email in separate apps. I get less real personal email and when it gets mixed in to the flood of work email, it gets lost. Keeping them in separate apps helps me keep up with personal email. I would consider both **[Spark](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-like-your-email-again/id997102246?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)** and **[Outlook](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook-email-calendar/id951937596?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)** in the demo phase as email clients is an area that I am always fiddling with.

##Social aka Aspirational Apps
**[Swarm](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/swarm-by-foursquare/id870161082?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)**, **[Instagram](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)**, and **[Snapchat](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)** are my current month trials. I want to leverage my phone as a way to be more connected with friends and family and these apps seem like fun ways to do that. I don't know if they'll stick, but I'm hopeful at least one will. **[Tweetbot](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-4-for-twitter/id1018355599?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)** is another long standing app that I would quickly install on a new phone. It's the best Twitter client I have ever used.

##Productivity
The top few rows are very stable and don't change very often. I use all of those apps on almost a daily basis. **[1Password](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335?mt=8&at=10lQ9L)** is an app that I recommend that everyone use.

I'm not sure which of these apps will stick from month to month. I try to carve out some time in the beginning of the month to decide what I want to focus on for the month and then choose apps that can help serve that focus. Apps I don't use, get moved off the home screen. It's a process that allows me to keep my home screen feeling fresh while also not slowing my down by too much fiddling.
