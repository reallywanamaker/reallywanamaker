We listen to a lot of Christmas music around the holidays, so I wanted to share some of the Wanamaker Family favorites.  We try to add a new album to the collection every year, but these are some of the standards that have stood the test of time year to year.  In reflecting on the list, I think that it's clear that beyond the music, many of these albums have a connection to family.  Whether it be a style that I grew up listening to or memories of watching a group on television with my daughter each of these albums has some sort of family connection.  However it still has to be good music to get regular plays in our house.

### [Christmas With the Beach Boys][BB]

Playing *Little Saint Nick* marks the begining of our Christmas season every year.  We typically play it Thanksgiving evening either on our drive home from family or in the cases where we are hosting, after everyone leaves.  Having grown up on a steady diet of the Beach Boys, I know that this album is as much evocative of my childhood and family memories as it is just a great Christmas album.  I am just grateful that my family loves it as much as I do.  This version is a combination of multiple Beach Boy Christmas albums, but we tend to stick to the first nine tracks (which makes up their first Christmas album).  The first half of those first tracks are all Beach Boy originals and are all great.
### [A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector][PS]

If you have followed Phil Spector at all, you know that it's strange to associate him with Christmas.  However this album evokes many of the same warm feelings that the Beach Boys album does.  The collection of artists put a fun upbeat twist on some of the great and less known holiday songs.  *Marshmallow World* is a household favorite and is probably only second to *Little Saint Nick* in terms of most frequently played song.
### [Aimee Mann - One More Drifter in the Snow][AM]

A fairly different album compared to the first two on the list, this album being is much more sparse musically.  One More Drifter tends to come on in the evening when we aren't looking to pump up the energy of the kids, but still want to keep the Christmas vibe flowing.  *You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch* is fun and the original song, *Calling On Mary*, is very good, but *God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen* and *I'll Be Home for Christmas* really stand out.
### [Elf][ELF]

Full disclosure: I've never really seen this movie (even though we do own it).  But that hasn't stopped this album from becoming a household favorite.  I don't think I had heard the versions of any the songs on this album prior to getting it, yet many of them quickly become amongst my favorite versions.  Ella Fitzgerald's *Sleigh Ride* and Brian Setzer's *The Nutcracker Suite* are both great while Leon Redbone & Zooey Deschanel dueting in *Baby, It's Cold Outside* has basically ruined every other version of the song for me.
### [Michael Bublé - Christmas][MB]
![Bublé](http://a3.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Music6/v4/3f/c7/50/3fc750d3-a5ac-a84a-149f-c0a8af18a337/cover170x170.jpeg)
I tend to like the idea of the [rat pack][RP] more than actually listening to them. We have multiple versions of different rat pack/jazz crooners holiday albums and while I like then all right they never end up in regular rotation. Michael Bublé does a great job of capturing some of that style while bringing to life to what I consider some of the more boring holiday songs.  *Santa Baby* is very cleverly done (but not too clever that it becomes too smart for it's own good) and *All I Want For Christmas Is You* has a life to it that I don't hear in a lot of other versions of the song.
### [Pentatonix - That's Christmas To Me][P]
![Pentatonix](http://a1.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Music5/v4/6e/4c/82/6e4c82bf-a4d3-ab18-883b-085a013d0be0/cover170x170.jpeg)
Perhaps the newness of the album will wear off but at least for this year, we are enjoying this album and it's easily been our most played album this year. My family watched Pentatonix compete in [The Sing Off][SO] and they were and continue to be a group that defies my expectations of instruments and singing.  The mashup of *Winter Wonderland / Don't Worry Be Happy* is my favorite.
